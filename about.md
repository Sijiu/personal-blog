My name is Ryan Palo.  I'm a mechanical engineer, currently living in the Oakland, CA area.  I've specifically got a focus on mold tool design, design for manufacturability/moldability, and turbomachinery.  A lot of my turbomachinery calculations have been supported by Python scripts to optimize designs.  I'm currently programming and learning everything I can as a hobby, but I'm open to anything.  I would love to be mentored in the software engineering/development world.  My ultimate goal is to learn as much as I can so I can teach other people about programming and get them as excited about it as I am.  As you can see from the tags, my main experience is in Python, but I've dabbled in Ruby, JavaScript, R, and a few others.

I'm creating this blog to keep track of all of the things I'm learning about.  In the past year or so, I've really started to learn a lot about a lot of different software/coding things.  Part of this is so that I can track my progress and feel accomplished in a year instead of feeling like a failure when I look up and still see how much there is that I don't know.  My goal is to at least post something every two weeks.  Hopefully I can even improve on that.  I'll write about what I am currently learning, what is interesting to me, and try to explain the things that I'm learning to cement that knowledge.  Probably, this won't be interesting to anybody but me, but that's ok.
    
This will also be a good way to exercise my writing muscle, and get more practice and fluency with Markdown, Git, Jekyll, and the various other components that are coming together to make this happen.

The other function of this site is the to-do list.  I tend to skip from project to project learning little dabs of each new thing before getting distracted by the new thing, and I want to try to put that new thing on the to-do list and keep my head down and working on the current thing, so that hopefully I will get a deeper understanding of the things that I am learning.  If anyone actually does read this blog, I'd love to hear what you think, go ahead and shoot me an email or message me on any of the available social medias... medii?.. median?  Moods?  Whatever.
