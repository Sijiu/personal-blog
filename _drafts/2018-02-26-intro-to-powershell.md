My relationship with the terminal has been a bit of a roller coaster.  I first discovered the terminal when I first heard about Python and didn't know anything about anything.  I heard about Python in a [a few](https://xkcd.com/353/) different [XKCD comics](https://xkcd.com/844/) and wanted to see what it was.  Like a normal person who used computers for games and applications like Excel and PowerPoint, I went to the site, downloaded the installer, installed it, and clicked the icon.  Imagine, to my horror, when this popped up.

*Where are the buttons?  What's with the old-timey font?  What do I do with my mouse?*

After beginning to program more and more, and learning about the terminal, I began to love Bash.  Is it archaic?  Yes.  Are the commands non-intuitive and difficult to remember?  Heck, yes.  For some reason, this just made me love it more.  I had to work hard at it, and typing a bunch of what appears to be gobbledey-gook (`du -sk * | sort -n | tail`, for example) that had powerful results made me feel like a wizard.  As I learned more, I was able to customize how it looked and get fonts and colors and prompts that made the terminal that much more inviting.

So I decided to take my newly found programming powers to work.  Except that I work as a mechanical engineer, and typically that means Windows and SolidWorks (although that seems to be changing a little bit).  So I opened up the recommended terminal, PowerShell.  And again, to my horror:

*No problem,* I thought.  I'll just go to the Preferences screen.

Oh, no.  We're not in Kansas anymore.  Not exactly what I was used to.  So I went into powershell and tried to do some simple things.  Some things worked fine!  `ls`, `cd`, and `mkdir` all worked like I was used to.  But I couldn't figure out why setting the `$PATH` was so hard to do.  And what is with all these backslashes?  How come I can't `sudo`?  More and more little irritations that kept reminding me that I *wasn't using Bash* kept cropping up.  I gave up and installed [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), which allowed me to have a bash experience on my Windows 7 computer.  Except not quite.  Everything I tried to do to get back to Bash on my Windows machine was justâ€¦ not quite right.

Finally, recently, I threw in the towel and began to work on learning PowerShell the right way, from the beginning, as another language.  As I learned, I found myself buying into the whole PowerShell philosophy, and noticing the things that were a little bit nicer than when I was using Bash.  Now, just like everything, PowerShell is just another tool in the toolbox, and whether or not it's the best tool really depends on the situation.  My goal here is to show you the basics and get you started on your own PowerShell journey.
