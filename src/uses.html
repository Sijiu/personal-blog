<p>Wes Bos does this thing that I think is cool.  He has a page on his site called <a href="http://wesbos.com/uses">Uses</a>, where he lays out all of the tools and things that he uses.  I think that's neat, helps developers come together, and can provide neat new tools to people that have never heard of them before.  So, without further ado:

<h2>Editor/Terminal</h2>
<ul class="dotted">
    <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>!  It's super awesome.  Awesome enough to pull me over from Sublime Text even.</li>
    <li>I use a theme called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustinsanders.an-old-hope-theme-vscode">An Old Hope</a>.  Star Wars!</li>
    <li>Currently, my favorite font is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>.  I'm a big fan of the programming symbol ligatures.</li>
    <li>I just started using <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper Term</a> because it works on Mac and Windows, so I don't have to mentally adjust between home and work.  Also, styling and customization is in JavaScript and CSS, which is easier for me.  Also.  <a href="https://github.com/zeit/hyperpower">HyperPower</a>.  Trust me.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Apps</h2>
<ul class="dotted">
    <li><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> to replace Mac Spotlight</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</a> for Mac window management</li>
    <li><a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> for email.  It's so smart/intelligent!</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.duetdisplay.com/">Duet</a> for using Ipad as another screen.  Worth.  It.</li>
</ul>
