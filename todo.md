## Dive Deeper
- &#9633; System administration: managing systems, spinning up servers, handling infrastructure, security, etc.
- &#9633; Ruby: object oriented programming, actually building apps
- &#9633; Rails: I've done the intro course.  Now I want to get some practice with it.
- &#9633; Django: I can do it, but I need a lot more practice to get better.  Same with...
- &#9633; Raspberry Pi and the IoT.  I want to make cool robits and API's to automate things in my house.  Also, I want to connect this to Slack, because I hear that's a thing.

## Look Into It
- &#9633; Mazes: podcast by the Ruby Rogues convinced me to look into the programming and math behind mazes
- &#9633; Containerization such as Docker or similar technologies
- &#9633; SVG?  I'm not sure.  I've just seen some neat art.
