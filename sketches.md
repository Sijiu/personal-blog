These are a few animations/sketches/interactive-javascripty-arty-things that I've done and are available.  I think they're cool.  Check them out!

[Food Chain](/foodchain)
Automata that run around looking for food.  They grow and slow as they eat and shrink and speed up and eventually die as they can't find food.

---

[Trigonometry](/trigonometry)
A cool illustration of where we get sines and cosines from.

---

[Algae Growth](/algae1)
An interactive algae builder based on P5js tutorials.
