My Approach to Getting Things Done

How do you keep track of your thoughts? How do you make sure that everything you need to do gets done? Everybody has some sort of systemâ€”even not having a system and trying to remember everything is technically a system. I wanted to share mine, because it seems to work pretty well.

There's an method that is pretty established called the "Getting Things Done" (GTD) approach for managing the things that you have to do. It was created by David Allen. You can read more about the philosophy behind it on the Getting Things Done website. I'll go over my process, which is loosely based on it. I like to think about it in terms of a few catchy mantras.

1. Remember Nothing.  Record Everything.

Find someplace to store all the things you need to think about and remember. I've found that Trello really fits with how my brain works, so I use that. I call this my Other Brain. To-do's, ideas, projects, everything. Don't remember anything. You're not good at it. The very second you have the thought or remember something you have to do, put it in your Other Brain. And as you put it in there, try to sort your thoughts in order of urgency and/or ease of completion. I like to put the things that I need to (or can) finish first down at the bottom of my lists and work my way up.



Feel free to make your boards pretty and create various categories for different parts of your brain. Or use something else. Or use an actual paper notebook. Just get it out of your head!

2. Your Inbox is a Receiving Area, not a To-Do List

I used to keep things in my e-mail inbox until I was done with them. Then, I realized that having a full inbox stresses me out. It makes me feel like I have a billion things to do, and there's no categorizing or organization. It's just a big ðŸ’©-pile of things that make me feel bad and give me anxiety. Now, a couple times a day, I open up my email. For each thing, if I can handle it quickly, I take care of it right away. If it's going to take me a little while to track down the answer or information I need to respond, I enter it into my Other Brain and put it in its corresponding email folder. One way or another, it's out of my inbox in five minutes, tops. Generally, this lets me get to Inbox Zero in less than an hour. (Hopefully).

3. Get Things Done, One Bite at a Time

After you've stemmed the tide of ideas, emails, and people asking you to do things, open up your Other Brain and get to work. Don't get freaked out by everything that's on your list, because it will probably be a lot. It's your whole Other Brain! But since you don't have to spend valuable time remembering all the things you have to do, you're going to be able to fully focus on your tasks. And since you've already pre-sorted your thoughts, you should be able to look at your list and find the first thing that needs done. Do it.  Don't think about any of the other things. Once you're done, cross it off, archive it, jot some notes, or do whatever you have to do to close it out. And find the next thing. Do it again and again until you are tired, hungry, or your list is empty.

The nice thing about this approach is that it matters less if you get interrupted or if somebody jams something in the front of your queue in a panic. You just handle the interruption, file it in the Other Brain, and when they go away, you get right back into your (possibly newly rearranged) tasks!

Wrap Up

That's it. Remember nothing, get everything out of your brain and your inbox, record everything somewhere, and do the things you can, when you can focus, one bite at a time. So far, it's worked really well for meâ€”in my personal life and at work too. How do you keep yourself organized and productive? Do you have any awesome productivity tools? I always love to hear about other people's tools and systems.
