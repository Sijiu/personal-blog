My name is Ryan Palo.  I'm a mechanical engineer, currently living in the Oakland, CA area.  I've specifically got a focus on mold tool design, design for manufacturability/moldability, and turbomachinery.  A lot of my turbomachinery calculations have been supported by Python scripts to optimize designs.

I'm currently programming and learning everything I can as a hobby, but I'm open to anything.  I would love to experience the software engineering/development world.  My ultimate goal is to learn as much as I can so I can teach other people about programming and get them as excited about it as I am.  As you can see from the tags, my main experience is in [Python](/tags/python/) and [Ruby](/tags/ruby/), but I've done some work in [JavaScript](/tags/javascript/), [R](/tags/R/), Golang, and a few others.

I'm creating this blog to keep track of all of the things I'm learning about.  In the past couple of years or so, I've started to learn a lot about different aspects of software and programming.  I want to be able to track my progress and feel accomplished in a year instead of feeling like a failure when I look up and still see how much there is that I don't know.  My goal is to at least post something every two weeks.  Hopefully I can even improve on that.  I'll write about what I am currently learning, what is interesting to me, and try to explain the things that I'm learning to cement that knowledge.  Probably, this won't be interesting to anybody but me, but that's ok.
    
This will also be a good way to exercise my writing muscle, and get more practice and fluency with Markdown, Git, Jekyll, and the various other components that are coming together to make this happen.

I love getting feedback and hearing from other people of different skill/experience levels in the community.  I want to hear what you think, so please shoot me an email or message me on any of the available social medias... medii?.. median?  Moods?  Whatever.
