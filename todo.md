# To Do

## Dive Deeper
- [ ] System administration: managing systems, spinning up servers, handling infrastructure, security, etc.
- [ ] Ruby: object oriented programming, actually building apps
- [ ] Rails: I've done the intro course.  Now I want to get some practice with it.
- [ ] Django: I can do it, but I need a lot more practice to get better.  Same with...
- [ ] Flask.
- [ ] Raspberry Pi and the IoT.  I want to make cool robits and API's to automate things in my house.  Also, I want to connect this to Slack, because I hear that's a thing.
- [ ] I have to finish the OSSU Computer Science degree.  I'm approximately 1.5 classes into it right now.  Soon to be improved.

## Look Into It
- [ ] Mazes: podcast by the Ruby Rogues convinced me to look into the programming and math behind mazes
- [ ] Configuration Management: I want to learn Ansible or Chef
- [ ] Containerization such as Docker or similar technologies
- [ ] Webpack.  It seems like the tool to know.
- [ ] SVG?  I'm not sure.  I've just seen some neat art.
