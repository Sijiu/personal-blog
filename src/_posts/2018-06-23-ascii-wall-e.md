Two things.  1. I'm trying out the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).  So far I like it!  2. I made Wall-E!

![Wall-E in my terminal](/img/wall-e.jpg)

On their website, the fish shell has a neat ascii picture of a fish.  I saw examples of people putting that in their initial greeting when the terminal opens up.  I thought that was neat, but I wanted something more my style.  So I spent a few *cough* <small>hours</small> *cough* making Wall-E, and now he says hello to me whenever I open up my terminal!

In case you're curious, I put the code [into a gist](https://gist.github.com/rpalo/cd77a94616b0a30d1c2a2f18d6bc7581).

Challenge!  Make your own ASCII art and share it.

Happy Saturday!
